# Weather_Dashboard

## Description

Given a screenshot of a weather dashboard, my task is to create a weather dashboard which allows the user to search for a city and have the current and future weather conditions displayed on the page.

NOTE: I have had multiple work committments this week that have not allowed me to work on this project, and I don't feel well. This project is a work in progress.

## Process

The first step n this process was to go to the [OpenWeather website](https://openweathermap.org/) and create an account to get an API token.

### index.html

1. I added the basic tags to the ```.html``` file so I would have a structure to build from.
2. I used Bootstrap to help get the design together.
3. I added bootstrap containers rows and columns to define the areas of the page. 

### script.js

1. 


### style.css



## How To Contribute

Suggestions are always welcome. I'm sure this is not the most elegant way to write this code, and there could be improvement. I am unable to finish working on this project before the due date. IT is a work in progress.
