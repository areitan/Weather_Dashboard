# Weather_Dashboard

## Description

Given a screenshot of a weather dashboard, my task is to create a weather dashboard which allows the user to search for a city and have the current and future weather conditions displayed on the page.

NOTE: I have had multiple work committments this week that have not allowed me to work on this project, and I don't feel well. This project is a work in progress, but I am unable to complete it at the moment.

## Process

1. The first step n this process was to go to the [OpenWeather website](https://openweathermap.org/) and create an account to get an API token.
2. I drew a wireframe with pencil and paper to try to map out how to use bootstrap contianers, rows and columns.

### index.html

1. I added the basic tags to the ```.html``` file so I would have a structure to build from.
2. I used Bootstrap to help get the design together and added the links to the ```.html``` file.
3. I added bootstrap containers rows and columns to define the areas of the page. 
4. Added JQuery link.
5. Started adding ID's for use in the ```.js``` file.


### script.js

1. I started adding variables.


### style.css



## How To Contribute

Suggestions are always welcome. I'm sure this is not the most elegant way to write this code, and there could be improvement. There are many elements yet to be added. I need to write out the javascript and add functionality for pulling from the OpenWeather API. I am unable to finish working on this project before the due date. It is a work in progress.
